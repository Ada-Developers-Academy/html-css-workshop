## Practice

Spend some time practicing what we've learned by expanding your web page
<ul class="small">
<li>Try to use something you're not quite comfortable with</li>
<li>Feel free to work in pairs, ask for help, etc.</li>
</ul>

<br>

What's next
<ul class="small">
<li>**10-minute warning** at 11:50 (this is a good time to take a break!)</li>
<li>At **12:00 sharp** we will come together for questions and wrap-up</li>
<li>At 12:10 we transition to the next module (deployment)</li>
</ul>

## 10 Minute Warning

We'll come together at 12:00 for questions and wrap-up

<br>

Take a break if you need it (or even if you're not sure!)

<br>

Having that little reset is important before we move on
